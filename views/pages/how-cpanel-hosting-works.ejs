                                    cPanel-based Website Hosting offerings on the present web hosting market are provided by a
                                    quite insubstantial marketing segment (as far as annual money flow is concerned) named
                                    reseller hosting. Reseller website hosting is a sort of a small-scale marketing niche, which
                                    supplies a great number of different web hosting trademarks, yet furnishing literally the
                                    same solutions: mostly cPanel web hosting services. This is bad news for everybody. Why?
                                    Because at least 98 percent of the web hosting offers on the whole website hosting
                                    marketplace offer the same service: cPanel. There's no diversity at all. Even the cPanel
                                    Website Hosting price tags are identical. Very identical. Leaving for those who demand a top
                                    web hosting service virtually no other website hosting platform/hosting Control Panel
                                    alternative. Thus, there is only one single fact: out of more than 200k website hosting
                                    trademarks worldwide, the non-cPanel based ones are less than 2 percent! Less than two
                                    percent, remark that one...</p>

                                <h4>200k "Website Hosting firms", all cPanel-based, yet uniquely labeled
                                </h4>
                                <p>The Website Hosting "diversity" and the website hosting "offerings" Google presents
                                    to all of us come down to just one and the same solution: cPanel. Under hundreds of
                                    1000's of different website hosting brand names. Suppose you are just an ordinary
                                    bloke who's not well aware of (as most of us) with the web page development
                                    processes and the hosting platforms, which in fact power the separate domain names
                                    and web sites. Are you prepared to make your web hosting selection? Is there any web
                                    hosting variant you can decide upon? Of course there is, as of now there are more
                                    than 200,000 web hosting vendors out there. Formally. Then where is the difficulty?
                                    Here's where: more than 98 percent of these more than two hundred thousand unique
                                    web hosting brands worldwide will give you literally the same cPanel web hosting
                                    Control Panel and platform, labeled differently, with the same price tags! WOW!
                                    That's how large the assortment on today's web hosting marketplace is... Period.</p>

                                <h4>The Website Hosting LOTTERY we are all participating in
                                </h4>
                                <p>Simple math demonstrates that to select a non-cPanel based web hosting service
                                    provider is a gigantic stroke of luck. There is a less than 1 in fifty chance that a
                                    thing like that will take place! Less than 1 in 50...

                                <h4>The positive and negative aspects of the cPanel Website Hosting solution


                                </h4>
                                <p>Let's not be harsh with cPanel. After all, in the years 2001-2004 cPanel was modish
                                    and presumably covered all web hosting business preconditions. To put it briefly,
                                    cPanel can do the trick if you have just one single domain name to host. But, if you
                                    have more domain names...


                                </p>

                                <br>

                                <h4>Negative Point No.1: A dumb domain folder structure
                                </h4>
                                <p>If you have 2 or more domain names, however, be ultra attentive not to remove
                                    completely the add-on ones (that's how cPanel will refer to each next hosted domain
                                    name, which is not the default one: an add-on domain). The files of the add-on
                                    domain names are very easy to remove on the web hosting server, because they all are
                                    placed into the root folder of the default domain, which is the very famous
                                    public_html folder. Each add-on domain name is a folder situated inside the folder
                                    of the default domain name. Like a sub-folder. Next time try not to remove the files
                                    of the add-on domain names, please. Discover for yourself how excellent cPanel's
                                    domain name folder arrangement is:

                                <p>Are you becoming puzzled? We definitely are!</p>

                                <h4>Weakness Number Two: The same email folder system
                                </h4>
                                <p>The e-mail folder structure on the server is strictly the same as that of the domain
                                    names... Repeating the very same mistake twice?!? The admin boys strongly increase
                                    their faith in God when managing the email folders on the mail server, hoping not to
                                    muck things up too gravely. </p>
                                <h4>Shortcoming Number Three: A total lack of domain name administration menus

                                </h4>
                                <p>Do we need to refer to the absolute lack of a contemporary domain name management
                                    tool - a location where you can: register/relocate/renew/park or manage domains,
                                    modify domain names' Whois information, protect the Whois details, edit/create
                                    nameservers (DNS) and DNS resource records? cPanel does not involve such a
                                    "contemporary" section at all. That's an immense problem. An unjustifiable one, we
                                    wish to add...

                                </p>
                                <h4>Negative Aspect No.4: Multiple user login locations (min 2, maximum 3)

                                </h4>
                                <p>What about the necessity for another login to utilize the billing transaction, domain
                                    and technical support management menu? That's beside the cPanel account login
                                    credentials you've been already supplied by the cPanel Website Hosting provider. Now
                                    and then, based on the invoicing system (especially invented for cPanel only) the
                                    cPanel Website Hosting service provider is making use of, the keen clients can end
                                    up with two additional login locations (1: the invoicing transaction/domain
                                    management software platform; 2: the trouble ticket support software platform),
                                    winding up with an aggregate of three login locations (including cPanel).

                                </p>
                                <h4>Drawback Number 5: More than a hundred and twenty Control Panel menus to pick up...

                                <p>cPanel offers for your consideration more than a hundred and twenty departments
                                    inside the Control Panel. It's a marvelous idea to grasp each of them. And you'd
                                    better pick them up briskly... That's excessively impudent on cPanel's side.</p>
                                <p>With all due appreciation, we have a rhetorical question for all cPanel Website
