                            different web portals with regard to the resources or the shared hosting platform they need.
                            To select the most relevant shared hosting service for your web portal, you must judge what
                            server-side software programs it needs, how many daily visits you anticipate at the
                            beginning and in the future, as well as any other special needs that may need to be
                            satisfied.

                                <h4>Shared Hosting - Strong Points</h4>
                                <p>The most relevant choice for small sized sites with several hundred or several
                                    thousand visitors is a shared hosting package. With this form of website hosting,
                                    each user pays only for their account, which reduces the overall cost per customer
                                    radically. There are different web hosting solutions differing from one hosting
                                    supplier to another, furnishing different quotas of server space and bandwidth,
                                    different mail account quotas and so on. The benefit is that you can order an
                                    account that will have the features your site in fact demands. You will not need to
                                    pay a lot of cash for a plan you will not utilize, or end up with a small sized
                                    account that cannot accommodate the website. We, at educloud, offer an immense
                                    choice of shared hosting packages suitable for private or small business web pages
                                    that even include pre-activated script-based platforms such as Joomla, Mambo, Drupal
                                    or WordPress - to make it simpler. If you commence with a low-price account and you
                                    demand more resources, upgrading to a better account takes just a click. </p>

                                <h4>Shared web hosting - Negative Points</h4>
                                <p>A weakness of the shared web hosting environment is that the hosting servers have some software platforms installed on them and you are unable to install new software. Given websites, above all online stores, request applications to be present on the server for them to operate, and with a shared web hosting platform, you can activate only software that does not require complete root access.</p>

                                <br>

                                <h4>Private Virtual Hosting Servers and Dedicated Web Hosting Servers
                                </h4>
                                <p>For web portals that demand full server root access, or if your website has many thousands or even 1 000 000's of visitors per day, what you require is a virtual private servers or a dedicated server. A virtual private web hosting server is a software simulation of a dedicated hosting server and it functions in an absolutely identical manner.</p>

                                <br>

                                <h4>VPS Web Hosting Servers
                                </h4>
                                <p>Both solutions commonly offer complete root-level access and can be restarted through a software tool by the client, independently from the hosting provider. Just like the shared hosting packages, the virtual private servers and the dedicated server hosting plans involve diverse features based on what the hosting vendor offers. A VPS server web hosting plan contains guaranteed hard disk storage, random access memory and CPU quotas that can sometimes be boosted for brief stretches of time on condition that there are free resources on the physical server. With a dedicated server, the only limiting factor is the hardware configuration it is availing of, and it can be revamped by changing or appending components. A VPS hosting server is simpler to manipulate as it offers a virtualization tool, which can be used to reboot it, to install software applications, check stats, etc. The management of a dedicated web server is more complex, so such a package would rather be resorted to by knowledgeable clients.

                                <h4>Dedicated Web Hosting Servers
                                </h4>
                                <p>Still, given hosting firms provide managed dedicated web hosting solutions where they run dedicated web server management tasks on behalf of the customer. This can be a part of package or an extra option.
                                </p>

                                <h4>Prior To Opting...
                                </h4>
                                <p>Picking the top hosting plan is crucial as it can have an influence on the stable functioning of a online portal. Before opting for a package, compare the pros and cons, study thoroughly all the requirements for the web portal to function properly, particularly if it is script-based.
